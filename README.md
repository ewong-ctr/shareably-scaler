# Instructions
This is my first React App.  
I have a config file where you can specify the date range and metrics to query on, but the calculations I used to create a proposed budget depends on *spend*, *revenue*, and *impressions* (*clicks* is optional since it's not used in the calculations).

The proposed budgets were created using arbitrary scaling factors based on the Average ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) and the linear trend of the ROAS over the queried date range, as well as the average PPI (Profit Per Impression).  This methodology assumes there is unlimited budget.

To run:
`npm install`
`npm start`

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your internet browser.

When you click on a row of data, a details table appears on the righthand side, which shows all the data retrieved across the date range for that particular ad.

## Known Bugs
* Not working on a date range of 1 day (i.e. startDate==endDate)


# Default Create-React-App Documentation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
